### Instructions to run server from terminal ###

1)  To run the python server, go to the chessmate directory and type the following command-

python back/server.py

from the chessmate directory. Also, this command will only work with Python2 and not with Python3.

2) Now, once the server is running on the terminal, go to the browser and go to the following url 

localhost:9001

This will display the website.

3) To shut the server, press ‘ctrl c’ in the terminal.



### PUZZLES ###

The puzzles will go into the puzzles folder under front.


### Progress so far ###

I have made a server and put a very basic template of the initial webpage.
